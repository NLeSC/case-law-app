One instance of sigma represent\n   * one graph. It is possible to represent this grapĥ with several renderers\n   * at the same time. By default, the default renderer (WebGL + Canvas\n   * polyfill) will be used as the only renderer, with the container specified\n   * in the configuration.\n   *\n   * @param  {?*}    conf The configuration of the instance. There are a lot of\n   *                      different recognized forms to instantiate sigma, check\n   *                      example files, documentation in this file and unit\n   *                      tests to know more.\n   * @return {sigma}      The fresh new sigma instance.\n   *\n   * Instanciating sigma:\n   * ********************\n   * If no parameter is given to the constructor, the instance will be created\n   * without any renderer or camera. It will just instantiate the graph, and\n   * other modules will have to be instantiated through the public methods,\n   * like \"addRenderer\" etc:\n   *\n   *  > s0 = new sigma();\n   *  > s0.addRenderer({\n   *  >   type: 'canvas',\n   *  >   container: 'my-container-id'\n   *  > });\n   *\n   * In most of the cases, sigma will simply be used with the default renderer.\n   * Then, since the only required parameter is the DOM container, there are\n   * some simpler way to call the constructor. The four following calls do the\n   * exact same things:\n   *\n   *  > s1 = new sigma('my-container-id');\n   *  > s2 = new sigma(document.getElementById('my-container-id'));\n   *  > s3 = new sigma({\n   *  >   container: document.getElementById('my-container-id')\n   *  > });\n   *  > s4 = new sigma({\n   *  >   renderers: [{\n   *  >     container: document.getElementById('my-container-id')\n   *  >   }]\n   *  > });\n   *\n   * Recognized parameters:\n   * **********************\n   * Here is the exhaustive list of every accepted parameters, when calling the\n   * constructor with to top level configuration object (fourth case in the\n   * previous examples):\n   *\n   *   {?string} id        The id of the instance.
